# library-typescript
 Sistema de bibliotecas para treino de CRUD

In this personal project, I created a library system where users can add, edit, and delete books. 

For the development of this project, I utilized the following technologies:

- TypeScript;
- Node.js with Express;
- MySQL;
- Handlebars;
- CSS.

I also incorporated several libraries, such as Dotenv, Zod, Express-Session, and Limiter, to enhance the application's security.

Building this project was incredibly enjoyable and provided me with valuable experience in CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete) and MySQL.
