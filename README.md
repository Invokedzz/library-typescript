# library-typescript
 Sistema de bibliotecas para treino de CRUD

In this personal project, I created a library - where the user can insert books, edit and delete them.
For the creation of this whole thing, I used the following technologies:

- TypeScript;
- Node.JS + Express;
- MySQL;
- Handlebars;
- CSS.

Also, I used a lot of libraries, such as: Dotenv, Zod, Express-Session and Limiter (to create a safer app, overall).

This project was super fun to build, and made me learn a lot about CRUD (create, read, update and delete) and MySQL.

If you want to test this project, follow this steps:

- Have the aplication downloaded;
- In your terminal, type: npm run dev ./src/website.ts;
- Enter on LocalHost.

And It's done!
